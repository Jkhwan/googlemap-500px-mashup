### Lighthouse Labs Week 2 Day 4 Assignment - Google APIs

##### The purpose of this app is to create a mashup utilizing the Google Map APIs and 500px API

This assignment is to create a Javascript application centered around Google Maps. This is also the first time that I have experienced pair programming, by completing this project with another fellow students at Lighthouse Labs. Essentially, we have created an app that plots images returned from 500px API onto the google map, based on the geolocation of the area that is being viewed on the map. Markers are then displayed and the user can click on each to see the actual image.
